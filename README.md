# AppLauncher
Created: 09/19/2010

I created this application to use at work to launch all the applications that I need to open everyday. It has
the ability to launch each application in the order they were entered and I also included an ability to specify
an amount of time to wait before launching the next application. This was done because some of the applications
that I use everyday take longer to launch than others and if there isn't a delay, they will open up in the wrong
order. This isn't such a big deal since I can just rearrange the taskbar to how I want it, but it is much
easier to just have this done automatically.

***WARNING***: This application saves its data to the Windows Registry. It will require elevated privledges
(i.e. admin rights) to be able to work properly.
